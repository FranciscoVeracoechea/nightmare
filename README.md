# Nightmare ORM
Object Relational Mapping for **Node.js** and **PostgreSQL** insisted on Eloquent from php.


## Introduction:
The Nightmare ORM  provides a simple implementation of object relational mapping, for working with your database. Each database table has a corresponding **Model** *(ECMAScript 6 class)* which is used to interact with that table. Models allow you to query for data in your tables, as well as insert and update new records into the table. It is also safe because it prevents *SQL injection*.

## Installation
- using npm:

      npm install nightmare-orm --save

- using yarn:

      yarn add nightmmare-orm

## Dependency
This module depends of a pool connection generated by the npm module "pg" also known as [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).
